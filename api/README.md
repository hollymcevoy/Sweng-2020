# QnA bot application API
This is the QnA bot REST API. It is a basic REST API building using typescript, node and express. It controls internal logic about what is sent out to the front end client. 

## Getting Started

Navigate to the API folder and install the packages through node package manager
```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   ```
This will install the required dependencies to your local machine so that you can run the software. 

Run the development server
```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
After running this command you should receive a message in your console that the server is running on port 3000. 
'QnA API Server running on port: 3000'
