# SWENG-2022
Repository for the 2nd/ 3rd year module for the Software Engineering Project. 

This is the folder for the github repo. The Repo can be found at 

- https://github.com/hollymcevoy/Sweng-2022/

The repo is composed of two folder

- api (for the REST API built in Typescript)
- front (For the React application)

To get started you can clone the repo. 

You must have node, and node package manager installed. 

After cloning you can cd in to either the front or api folder. 

There you can find the scripts to run the application. 

The two communicate with each other. However the link provided in the application are meant to be used by a live API in the front end and in the backend. So these must be adjusted.
